Hello, I am very glad that you are interested in my idea and you write me messages. You support me, I asked to present a detailed vision of the project and tried to form the text of the macdown file. Can you tell me if this looks feasible? I had a problem, I have Debian and when I launched musescore & advertis at the same time, the system crashes. I need to figure out how to implement it and possibly make the background programs easier, if they don't do the job, the system still crashes.

Lag.
